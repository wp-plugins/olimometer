== Description ==

A dynamic fundraising thermometer with customisable height, currency and background colour or transparency.

The background of the thermometer image (the part with the text labels on) can be customised to fit in with your site's design. The height (or length?!?) of the thermometer can be customised, and the scale of the mercury bar will automatically asjust accordingly.

Also includes a widget for use on sidebars.

This plugin requires that the GD libraries are available within PHP.

If you wish the thermometer to have a transparent background then I suggest you still choose a background colour close to the actual background on which the thermometer will appear. This will ensure that the image blends in perfectly.
